# Auto-tagging build log

## What it does

- After a **text event** is created or edited, or an **audio event's
  transcription completes**, if the event has no user-selected tags and has
  some title/description text, the backend asks GroqCloud (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`) to
  suggest tags for it.
- The model may only pick from the user's **existing** tags — it can never
  create a new one (enforced server-side by rejecting an invalid response, not just
  by prompting).
- The current model response contains only selected tag ids. High reasoning is
  enabled but hidden, so no reasoning, sentiment, or location text is returned.
- Runs the same way transcription does: enqueued as a Cloud Task, processed
  by an internal worker endpoint, idempotent under retries.

## Files added

- `app/services/tagger.py` — GroqCloud chat-completions HTTP client (Hebrew
  event text, strict `json_schema` response format, exception taxonomy
  mirroring `transcriber.py`).
- `app/services/tagging.py` — worker orchestration (load event → call tagger
  → write result), mirrors `transcription.py`.
- `app/schemas/tagging.py` — `TagTask` (Cloud Tasks call body for
  `/internal/tag`).
- `scripts/test_tagging_manual.py` — throwaway manual script, not wired into
  the app or pytest (`pyproject.toml`'s `testpaths = ["tests"]` already
  excludes `scripts/`). Calls `tagger.suggest_tags()` directly against the
  real GroqCloud endpoint with a sample Hebrew entry and fake tags; prints the
  selected synthetic tags. Makes one real, billed API call — run it yourself, it isn't
  run automatically.
- `TAGGING_BUILD_LOG.md` — this file.

## Files changed

- `app/core/config.py` — added `tagger_api_key`, `tagger_model`,
  `tagger_base_url`, `tagger_timeout_s` settings (`LIMON_TAGGER_*` env vars).
- `app/models/event.py` — added nullable `suggested_location` (varchar 200)
  and `tag_reasoning` (varchar 2000) columns.
- `app/services/task_queue.py` — added `enqueue_tagging(event_id)`, refactored
  the shared Cloud Tasks creation logic (`_create_task`) so both transcription
  and tagging enqueue through it.
- `app/routers/internal.py` — added `POST /internal/tag` (same shape as
  `/internal/transcribe`: retry → 503, everything else → 200).
- `app/services/transcription.py` — after a successful transcript write, if
  the event still has no tags, enqueues tagging. Enqueue failures are logged
  and swallowed — they must not turn a successful transcription into a retry.
- `app/services/events.py` — added `_maybe_enqueue_tagging()`, called after
  `create_event()` (text events only) and after `update_event()` when
  `title`/`description` was part of the patch. Enqueue failures are logged
  and swallowed here too, since this runs inline in the user's request and
  Cloud Tasks is normally unconfigured in local dev.
- `CLAUDE.md` — documented the feature, config, and the manual `ALTER TABLE`
  needed on live databases.

## Historical follow-up: non-Hebrew characters leaked into `reasoning`

This section records behavior of the original integration. The GroqCloud migration described
below removed visible reasoning and this sanitizer, so the issue is no longer part of the active
tagging response.

Live testing found the model sometimes mixes Chinese/Cyrillic characters
mid-sentence into the `reasoning` field, even with `enable_thinking: false`
(observed examples: `מ夹括 פעילות גופנית`, `לчувתי די לחוץ`). Two changes in
`app/services/tagger.py`, `reasoning` only:

- **Strengthened the system prompt** with an explicit, separate instruction:
  Hebrew/Latin/digits/basic punctuation only, never Chinese/Cyrillic/Arabic
  anywhere in the response including `reasoning`, and to rephrase in Hebrew
  rather than reach for a foreign character.
- **Added `_sanitize_reasoning()`** as a safety net, applied to `reasoning`
  inside `_parse()` after schema validation. It's an *allowlist*, not a
  per-script denylist: anything outside the Hebrew block (`֐`–`׿`),
  basic Latin, digits, whitespace, and common punctuation is replaced with a
  single space (not deleted outright, so removing a stray character doesn't
  jam the two surrounding Hebrew words together), then repeated whitespace is
  collapsed. `tag_ids`, `sentiment`, and `suggested_location` are untouched,
  as asked.

**Verified:**
- Offline, against the two exact garbled strings above — both scripts
  stripped cleanly, clean Hebrew passed through unchanged (spot-checked via
  `_sanitize_reasoning()` directly, no network call).
- Live, via `scripts/test_tagging_manual.py` — no visible leakage in that
  run's `reasoning` output.

**Known limitation — this is a mitigation, not a guaranteed fix:**
- The prompt change can't force the model's behavior; it can still leak
  characters on some runs. The sanitizer is the actual backstop, and as an
  allowlist it should catch *any* disallowed script on `reasoning`, not just
  Chinese/Cyrillic/Arabic — but it only fixes the character-set problem, not
  semantic garbling (e.g. a wrong-but-still-Hebrew word).
- Per your instruction, only `reasoning` is sanitized. `suggested_location`
  is also free text extracted from the entry and could theoretically suffer
  the same leakage — it currently has no safety net. Say the word if you want
  it covered too.

## Follow-up: `reasoning` truncated mid-sentence

Cause: no `max_tokens` was set on the request at all — it relied entirely on
the original provider's server-side default, which was too low for `reasoning` plus the
rest of the structured response to complete.

Fix: added `_MAX_TOKENS = 1000` in `app/services/tagger.py`, wired into the
request body as `"max_tokens": 1000`.

**Verified live** via `scripts/test_tagging_manual.py`: `reasoning` now ends
on a complete sentence instead of stopping mid-word. No forbidden-script
(Chinese/Cyrillic/Arabic) characters observed in this run either.

**Observation, not acted on:** the same run showed a couple of spots where a
Latin/English word fragment glues directly onto a Hebrew word with no space
(e.g. `קulinריים`, `כneutral`) — a different, lower-severity issue than the
forbidden-script leak, since Latin letters are explicitly allowed by
`_sanitize_reasoning()`'s character range. Not fixed; flagging for awareness.

## Manual steps you still need to do

- **Live/Supabase databases** created before this change need the new
  columns added by hand (local SQLite gets them automatically on next
  startup):
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN suggested_location VARCHAR(200);
  ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN tag_reasoning VARCHAR(2000);
  ```
- **Local end-to-end testing needs Cloud Tasks configured** (`LIMON_TASKS_*`
  + `LIMON_TASKS_WORKER_URL` pointed at your own running instance) — same as
  transcription today, there's no dev shim. Without it, `POST /events` and
  `PATCH /events/{id}` will still work fine, just log
  `STEP=tagging_enqueue_failed` and skip tagging.
- **No tests yet** — you said you'd test manually and add tests in a
  follow-up. When you do, mirror `tests/test_transcriber.py` (for
  `tagger.py`), `tests/test_worker.py` (for `/internal/tag`), and the
  `enqueue_transcription` mocking pattern in `tests/test_trigger.py` /
  `tests/test_events.py` (for `enqueue_tagging`).

## Verification run (this environment)

`uv` wasn't installed anywhere on this machine; installed via
`pip install --user uv`, then `uv sync --extra dev`.

- `uv run ruff check .` — found and fixed one real line-length violation in
  `tagger.py`. Clean now.
- `uv run ruff format --check .` — clean.
- `uv run pytest` — **95 passed, 3 failed.** The 3 failures are **pre-existing
  and unrelated to tagging**: `test_supabase_admin.py::test_no_op_when_supabase_url_unset`,
  `test_tags.py::test_deleting_account_cascades_to_tags`,
  `test_users.py::test_delete_me_then_next_request_reprovisions_same_id`.
  Cause: local `.env` has `LIMON_SUPABASE_URL` set (to the placeholder value)
  but no `LIMON_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, so tests that assume Supabase is
  unconfigured instead hit the real (unconfigured) delete-account code path.
  Nothing this feature touched — worth a separate fix if it bothers you.
- The original `chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}` request shape
  was confirmed against the live endpoint (via `scripts/test_tagging_manual.py`)
  — no request-shape errors, structured output parsed successfully.

## Current migration outcome: GroqCloud

Tagging now uses GroqCloud's OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint with
`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`. The request enables `reasoning_effort: high` with hidden reasoning and uses
strict Structured Outputs. The visible response contains only `tag_ids`, dynamically constrained
to the authenticated event owner's supplied tag ids. Backend validation rejects any out-of-list
id before saving rather than filtering it silently.

Configuration remains under the existing names: `LIMON_TAGGER_API_KEY`,
`LIMON_TAGGER_MODEL`, `LIMON_TAGGER_BASE_URL`, and `LIMON_TAGGER_TIMEOUT_S`. The current model and
base URL are `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` and `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`. Focused tests cover Hebrew
selection, an empty result, invented-tag rejection, two-user isolation, provider errors, timeouts,
malformed responses, and rate limiting. The migration's synthetic live check selected only ids
from the supplied synthetic list.
