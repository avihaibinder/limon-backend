# LimON Backend

FastAPI backend for LimON, a React Native / Expo mobile app for quickly
capturing life events (text notes, voice notes) and reviewing them on a
timeline.

## Stack

Python 3.11+ · FastAPI · Pydantic v2 · SQLAlchemy 2 (async) · SQLite (dev)

```

Pattern per resource: `models/<x>.py` (ORM) → `schemas/<x>.py` (Pydantic) →
`services/<x>.py` (business logic) → `routers/<x>.py` (thin HTTP layer).
Follow this shape for any new resource (e.g. voice notes, insights).

## Current state (as of 2026-07-06)

Implemented: `events`, `tags`, `users` — full CRUD, mounted under `/api/v1`.
No authentication yet (users are created directly via `POST /users`; the
model already carries `provider` / `provider_subject` for future OAuth).
No voice notes, PDF export, insights, or widget support yet. Tables are
created automatically on startup (no migrations yet — see Notes below).

## Feature backlog

Legend: MVP = required for first release, P2 = later.

### Capture
- [x] Create empty event ("press the lemon") — MVP
- [x] Create a text note — MVP
- [ ] Create a voice note + transcribe to text (60s max) — MVP
- [x] Tags (create/list/rename/delete) — MVP

### Auth & account
- [ ] Authentication (OAuth; `users` model already has `provider`/`provider_subject`) — MVP
- [ ] Sign out — MVP
- [ ] Delete account — MVP
- [ ] Profile (incl. email) — MVP

### Timeline & organization
- [x] Timeline (list events) — MVP
- [x] Edit event
- [x] Delete event
- [ ] Sort/display ordering — MVP
- [ ] Date range selection: default week, plus week/month/quarter — MVP
- [ ] Granularity for event display — P2

### Export & insights
- [ ] Export to PDF — MVP
- [ ] Insights — MVP

### Platform
- [ ] Lock-screen widget — MVP
- [ ] Alert when nothing recorded for a configurable period — P2
- [ ] GPS tagging — P2

### Infra
- [x] Migrate DB target — decided: Supabase (Postgres) in production via
  `LIMON_DATABASE_URL` (asyncpg, session pooler); SQLite stays the local
  dev/test default
- [~] Blob storage — Google Cloud Storage. `POST /api/v1/uploads/audio/presign`
  returns a V4 signed PUT URL so the client uploads audio straight to GCS
  (`app/services/storage.py`). Signs via ADC + IAM signBlob (no private key on
  disk); config is bucket + optional signer SA only, so it repoints at any GCP
  account by env alone. Still TODO: create the voice-note record from the
  returned `object_key`, plus lifecycle/read-back
- [ ] Deploy — target is Cloud Run (free tier), DB URL via Secret Manager
- [x] CI — GitHub Actions runs lint (Ruff), format check, pytest (in-container), and a docker-compose smoke test on every push/PR
- [ ] Testing: unit tests exist for events/tags/users; need FE test coverage too
- [ ] Realtime DELETE privacy — P2. `events` and `tags` use `REPLICA IDENTITY
  FULL` (required: Realtime checks the owner-only RLS policy for UPDATEs
  against the WAL old-image, and under DEFAULT it lacks `user_id`, so updates
  silently drop). Trade-off, accepted eyes-open with the FE
  (`../fe-be-comms/FE_CONTRACT.tags-realtime.md` Confirm 3): Realtime applies
  no RLS to DELETE broadcasts, so every subscriber receives deleted rows'
  full old-record table-wide across users (tag names/colors, event
  titles/bodies). Later: (a) test `REPLICA IDENTITY USING INDEX` on a unique
  `(id, user_id)` index for `tags` — old image would carry just the two UUIDs,
  enough for the UPDATE RLS check, but unverified against Supabase Realtime
  and the index silently degrades identity to NOTHING if ever dropped; won't
  help `events`, whose FE consumes old-record data on UPDATEs; or (b) the real
  fix, migrate the whole Realtime setup to broadcast authorization (per-user
  private channels)
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] "Adi/matn" oracle machine — context TBD, ask user before assuming scope

## Conventions

- Async everywhere: routers and services are `async def`, use `SessionDep`
  (an `AsyncSession`) from `app.dependencies`.
- Routers stay thin: validation + 404/409 handling only; business logic and
  queries live in `services/`.
- IDs are UUID4 strings (`String(36)` primary keys), not integers.
- Timestamps are timezone-aware UTC (`DateTime(timezone=True)`).
- Settings are read via `get_settings()` (lru_cached `Settings`), all env
  vars prefixed `LIMON_`.

## Commands

Dependency management and execution use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
(not raw `pip`). `uv.lock` is the source of truth for pinned versions and
must be committed with any `pyproject.toml` dependency change.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev                    # create .venv, install deps (pinned via uv.lock)
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # dev server, docs at /docs
uv run pytest                          # run tests
uv run ruff check .                    # lint
uv run ruff format .                   # format
uv add <package>                       # add a runtime dependency
uv add --dev <package>                 # add a dev-only dependency
```

Linting/formatting is [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (config in
`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.ruff]`/`[tool.ruff.lint]`, 100-char line length).
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `ruff check` + `ruff format --check`,
runs `pytest` inside the `api` container via `docker compose run` (so tests
exercise the same environment the app ships in — matters more once a real
DB service replaces SQLite), and a smoke test that boots the full compose
stack and checks `/health`.

Optional local enforcement: `uv run python scripts/hooks/install.py`
installs a `pre-push` git hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-push`) that blocks
`git push` if `ruff check` or `ruff format --check` fail. It's opt-in per
machine — CI's `lint` job is what actually enforces this for everyone.

## Notes

- Tables are created automatically on startup; move to Alembic migrations
  before this needs real schema evolution in production.
- Demo seeding: `POST /api/v1/users/me/demo-data` backfills the caller's empty
  account with 6 demo tags + 10 text events (`app/services/demo_seed.py`,
  sourced from `spec-local/mock_data/DEMO_SEED.mock-data.md`), timestamps
  shifted so the newest row is "now". One-shot per account: success stamps
  `users.demo_seeded_at`; a repeat call or a non-empty account 409s. FE
  contract: `spec-local/FE_DEMO_SEED.md`. Live DBs created before this column
  need `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN demo_seeded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;`.
- Tag API (contract: `../fe-be-comms/FE_CONTRACT.tags-crud.md`): names are trimmed,
  `POST /tags` is upsert-by-name (`201` new / `200` existing, existing color never
  overwritten), tags carry a nullable opaque `color` (up to 32 chars), and
  `DELETE /tags/{id}` detaches the id from all the owner's events in the same
  transaction (each touched event gets a fresh `updated_at`, so Realtime echoes
  it). Live DBs created before the color column need
  `ALTER TABLE tags ADD COLUMN color VARCHAR(32);`.
- CORS defaults to `["*"]` for development — restrict `LIMON_CORS_ORIGINS`
  before deploying.
- `greenlet` is declared as a direct dependency (not left as SQLAlchemy's
  transitive/marker-based extra) because SQLAlchemy's platform marker for it
  omits macOS Apple Silicon (`arm64`), so `uv sync` would otherwise skip
  installing it on those machines and every async DB call would fail.
- `docker compose up --build` runs the API in a container (`Dockerfile` +
  `docker-compose.yml`), using `uv sync --frozen` at build time and `uv run
  uvicorn ...` as the run command to mirror local dev. SQLite data is
  persisted to the `limon-data` volume at `/app/data`. As real infra is
  added, extend `docker-compose.yml` with those services rather than
  introducing a separate compose file.
- Production DB is Supabase Postgres: point `LIMON_DATABASE_URL` at the
  IPv4 session pooler (`postgresql+asyncpg://postgres.<ref>:...@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?ssl=require`).
  The direct `db.<ref>.supabase.co` host is IPv6-only and unreachable from
  Cloud Run. The engine uses `pool_pre_ping=True` to survive pooler/idle
  disconnects.
- Blob storage is Google Cloud Storage via `google-cloud-storage`, signing
  upload URLs with Application Default Credentials + IAM signBlob — no
  key-style credentials in settings. Account-specific values live only in
  `LIMON_GCS_BUCKET` / `LIMON_GCS_SIGNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`. Local dev on a
  free-tier account:
  `gcloud auth application-default login`, create a bucket + a signer SA,
  grant your user `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on that SA and the
  SA `roles/storage.objectAdmin` on the bucket, then set the two env vars.
  On Cloud Run, the attached service account is the ADC identity.
- This file is intentionally a starting point — update it as decisions are
  made (DB choice, auth provider, storage, etc.).
